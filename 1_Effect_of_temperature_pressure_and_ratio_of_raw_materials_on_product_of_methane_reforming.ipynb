    "The carbon neutrality strategy presents both challenges and opportunities for the metallurgical industry. Hydrogen, recognized as a green energy source, demonstrates significant potential for application in metallurgy. The negative impact of carbon deposition on catalysts is a significant challenge in the large-scale industrial application of methane dry reforming to produce hydrogen-rich reducing gases for ironmaking. The code calculate the reformation reaction between CO2 and CH4 to produce CO and H2. "
